# TODO for Job Tracker

- [X] Get all the job postings for a single page into a dict or list

- Click through all job content
- Extract job content
    - [X] Title
    - [X] Company
    - [X] Application Link - Apply now doesn't work for link getting
    - [X] Job type
    - [X] Full job description

- [X] Go to next page and scrape all job postings and subsequent


- [ ] Convert all page object data into a csv file or a db file?
- [ ] Allow user to export data / save data to csv


- [ ] Make a flask application that can intake the csv files
- [ ] Display data on web page



## Ideas

- Get all the job postings from a search query, search all pages, put into a csv file
- Figure out a way to display that csv file into a nice job tracker page
