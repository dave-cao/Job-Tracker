# TODO for Job Tracker

- [ ] Get all the job postings for a single page into a dict or list
- [ ] 

- Click through all job content
- Extract job content
    - [X] Title
    - [X] Company
    - [X] Application Link - Apply now doesn't work for link getting
    - [X] Job type
    - [X] Full job description

- [ ] Go to next page and scrape all job postings and subsequent




## Ideas

- Get all the job postings from a search query, search all pages, put into a csv file
- Figure out a way to display that csv file into a nice job tracker page
